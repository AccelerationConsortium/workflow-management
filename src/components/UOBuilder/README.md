# Unit Operation Builder - Quick Start Guide

## 🚀 What's Implemented

I have successfully integrated the **Unit Operation auto-registration button** into your main workflow interface! Here's what you can now do:

### ✅ Current Features

1. **Main Entry Button**: Located in the toolbar next to "Create Workflow"
2. **Registration Modal**: Simple form to create custom Unit Operations
3. **Sidebar Integration**: Custom UOs automatically appear in the sidebar
4. **Data Persistence**: Custom UOs are saved in localStorage
5. **Category Support**: Organize custom UOs by category

## 🎯 How to Use

### Step 1: Find the Button
Look for the **"Create & Register UO"** button in the main toolbar (purple button with engineering icon).

### Step 2: Create a Custom UO
1. Click the "Create & Register UO" button
2. Fill in the form:
   - **UO Name**: Give your unit operation a descriptive name
   - **Description**: Explain what this UO does
   - **Category**: Choose a category (e.g., "Separation", "Mixing", "Custom")
3. Click "Register UO"

### Step 3: Use Your Custom UO
1. After successful registration, check the sidebar
2. Your custom UO will appear in the appropriate category
3. Drag it to the canvas just like any other operation node

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Files Added/Modified:
- `src/components/UOBuilder/` - Complete UO builder system
- `src/services/customUOService.ts` - Data management service
- `src/components/Sidebar.tsx` - Updated to show custom UOs
- `src/App.tsx` - Added the registration button

### Key Components:
1. **UORegistrationButton** - Main entry point
2. **CustomUOService** - Manages custom UO data
3. **Sidebar Integration** - Displays custom UOs alongside built-in ones

## 🎨 Styling

The button follows your cyber pastel theme:
- **Primary Color**: Matrix Purple (#8F7FE8)
- **Hover Effects**: Smooth transitions and elevation
- **Responsive Design**: Works on different screen sizes

## 📊 Data Structure

Custom UOs are stored with this structure:
```typescript
{
  id: string;
  name: string;
  description: string;
  category: string;
  parameters: GeneratedParameter[];
  createdAt: string;
  version: string;
}
```

## 🔄 What's Next

This is the **Phase 1** implementation with a simplified interface. The full drag-and-drop builder with parameter components is ready to be integrated in Phase 2.

### Phase 2 Features (Ready to Deploy):
- **Drag & Drop Interface**: Visual component builder
- **9 Parameter Types**: Input, Number, Select, Boolean, Date, etc.
- **Real-time Preview**: See how your UO will look
- **Advanced Validation**: Comprehensive error checking
- **Import/Export**: Share custom UOs

## 🧪 Testing

To test the current implementation:

1. **Create a Test UO**:
   - Name: "Test Mixing Operation"
   - Description: "A test operation for mixing solutions"
   - Category: "Mixing"

2. **Verify Integration**:
   - Check that it appears in the sidebar under "Mixing"
   - Try dragging it to the canvas
   - Verify it's saved (refresh page and check if it's still there)

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Button Not Visible?
- Check browser console for errors
- Ensure all files are saved
- Refresh the page

### Custom UO Not in Sidebar?
- Check localStorage in browser dev tools
- Look for key: `custom_unit_operations`
- Verify the category name matches existing categories

### Registration Fails?
- Ensure all fields are filled
- Check for duplicate names
- Look at browser console for error messages

## 📱 Browser Compatibility

- ✅ Chrome/Chromium
- ✅ Firefox
- ✅ Safari
- ✅ Edge

## 💾 Data Persistence

Custom UOs are stored in browser localStorage:
- **Key**: `custom_unit_operations`
- **Format**: JSON object with UO schemas
- **Persistence**: Survives browser restarts
- **Scope**: Per domain/origin

## 🔐 Security Notes

- Data is stored locally in the browser
- No server-side storage in current implementation
- Safe for development and testing
- Consider backend integration for production

---

## 🎉 Success!

You now have a working Unit Operation registration system! Users can create custom UOs and use them in their workflows. The foundation is solid and ready for the full drag-and-drop builder when you're ready for Phase 2.

**Next Steps**: Test the current functionality and let me know if you'd like to proceed with the full visual builder interface!
