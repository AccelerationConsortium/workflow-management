🛠️ Backend Refactoring Guide for Canvas Execution System

📌 Overview

This backend is undergoing a modular refactoring to support flexible, pluggable execution across multiple runtimes — including Python, Rust, simulation environments, and task orchestration tools like Prefect.

❗ This is not a full rewrite.
Existing modules (e.g., Prefect tasks, OT2 device drivers) must be preserved and reused.

⸻

✅ Goals of This Refactoring
	1.	Introduce a standardized execution interface
All executors (Python, Rust, Simulated, Prefect) should conform to a common ExecutorInterface.
	2.	Support config-driven execution
Canvas will export a structured JSON workflow, which should be executed through a centralized runner (run_from_config.py or equivalent service).
	3.	Enable future backend replacement
The new architecture should allow us to plug in:
	•	Rust device executors
	•	Go-based orchestration services
	•	Simulation layers
	•	External APIs (gRPC, REST)
	4.	Maintain backward compatibility
The current Prefect-based execution flow and device scripts (Python) must continue to work.

🧭 Development Guidelines for Cursor or Contributors
	•	✅ Create new modules only, clearly scoped and typed.
	•	❌ Do not delete or modify existing Python experiment code, Prefect flows, or OT2 device interfaces.
	•	✅ All new executors should subclass or implement BaseExecutor (Python) or ExecutorInterface (TypeScript).
	•	✅ Support async execution, even if current implementation is sync (for future scalability).
	•	✅ Ensure every task call goes through the executor interface, not direct function calls.
	•	✅ Add test stubs where possible for each new executor type.

🛤️ Execution Flow (Conceptual)

Canvas JSON → run_from_config.py
             ↓
     ExecutorRegistry.get(type)
             ↓
      executor.execute_task(params)
             ↓
   Python / Rust / Simulated logic
             ↓
         return result



⸻

🔮 Future Integration Points
	•	gRPC service layer to allow remote executor calls (e.g. Rust service)
	•	WebSocket status updates to frontend
	•	Log aggregation and persistent storage
	•	Full DAG support (optional, as needed)
	•	CI tests for multi-backend task execution
