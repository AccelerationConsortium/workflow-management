## Environment Variables

Each deployment method requires specific environment variables. Refer to:
- `deployment/environments/.env.example` for development
- `deployment/docker/.env.example` for Docker
- Individual deployment folders for platform-specific configurations

## Security Considerations

### Production Checklist
- [ ] Use strong passwords and secret keys
- [ ] Enable SSL/HTTPS
- [ ] Configure security headers
- [ ] Set up rate limiting
- [ ] Enable monitoring and logging
- [ ] Regular security updates
- [ ] Database backups
- [ ] Environment variable security

### Secret Management
- Use environment variables for sensitive data
- Leverage platform secret managers (AWS Secrets Manager, etc.)
- Never commit secrets to version control
- Rotate credentials regularly

## Monitoring and Logging

### Available Integrations
- **Sentry**: Error tracking and performance monitoring
- **CloudWatch**: AWS infrastructure monitoring
- **Vercel Analytics**: Built-in performance analytics
- **Netlify Analytics**: Traffic and performance insights

### Log Aggregation

- Error alerting and notifications

## Backup and Recovery

### Database Backups
- **Docker**: Volume snapshots
- **AWS RDS**: Automated backups with point-in-time recovery
- **Kubernetes**: Persistent volume snapshots

### File Storage Backups

- **Local**: Regular backup scripts
- **CDN**: Edge caching for performance

## Support and Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Build failures**: Check environment variables and dependencies
2. **Database connection**: Verify credentials and network access
3. **CORS errors**: Configure allowed origins
4. **SSL issues**: Check certificate configuration

### Getting Help
- Check deployment logs
- Review configuration files
- Consult platform documentation
- Open GitHub issues for bugs
